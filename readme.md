# MakeBlock bluetooth communication

With this script, we can now communicate with the MakeBlock Bluetooth module without relying on the MakeBlock software! And more importantly, we can now use Arduino IDE to program the MakeBlock robot!

# How to use
To test the code, you will need to have the following installed:
- firmware_for_auriga.ino uploaded
- Change the DEVICE_ADDRESS variable to the MAC address of your Bluetooth module
  - Use your phone to find the MAC address of the Bluetooth module
  - Or use the scan_robots.py script to find the MAC address of the Bluetooth module
- Test the by changing the commented commands.

# Warning!
For now the code is only in the super-alpha stage, so it may not work as expected. I will try to improve it as soon as possible.
